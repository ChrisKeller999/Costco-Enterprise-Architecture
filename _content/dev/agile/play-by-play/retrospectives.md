title: Retrospectives
---
On the last day of the Sprint, hold a **Demo**, a **Retrospective**, then **Plan your next Sprint**

> **Who: Each Squad**
> **When: Last Day of the Sprint**
> Get started with this  **[(3 minute video)](http://agileacademy.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/standalone/retrospective/){:target="_blank"}** from the IBM Agile Academy about how to run a Retrospective

Retrospectives are a key Agile practice that, when practiced well, help a Squad gain the ability to make their own lives better. There are a variety of ways to run retrospectives, here's a popular format to use.

* On a regular basis, get together with your Squad and ask yourself:
    * What has gone well?
    * What hasn't gone well?
    * What are some experiments we can try to make things better?
* Make sure people own and actually try the experiments.
* Repeat, every few weeks.

Hold your retrospective **after** your **End of Sprint Demo** and **before** you plan for you next Sprint.

## Tools for Distributed Retrospectives
If a Squad isn't co-located, or you want to hold a Whole Team / End of Project Retrospective, you'll have a much easier time using one of the following tools...

### Slack
[Slack](http://ibm-watsonhealth.slack.com){:target="_blank"} is a non-obvious choice but actually works incredibly well, _especially for large, distributed teams_.

- Use the channel that your Squad/Product/Project already uses
- Timebox your Retrospective (an hour for a Squad, a day for a large group)
- Divide the chat into "sections" using Slack Threads to keep the Retrospective **focused**
  - Working Well Section:<br>

    ```> :thumbsup:  *Working Well*```<br>
    ```> Please list things that have been working well, they can be technical, process, cultural, nearly anything at all. Use reactions ( :thumbsup: / :thumbsdown: / :clap: / etc) to show how you feel about anything in this section. Try and use complete sentences so that we can look back and understand everything clearly...```

  - Things that didn't work well:<br>

    ```> :thumbsup:  *Working Well*```<br>
    ```> Please list things that have been working well, they can be technical, process, cultural, nearly anything at all. Use reactions ( :thumbsup: / :thumbsdown: / :clap: / etc) to show how you feel about anything in this section. Try and use complete sentences so that we can look back and understand everything clearly...```

  - Experiments you can try:<br>

    ```> :alembic:  *Experiments*```<br>
    ```> Please list some *experiments* the team can try that you feel could make things better. Reference items from the feedback already captured and we'll use reactions ( :thumbsup: / :thumbsdown: ) to vote on which of the experiments the team will try. Try and use complete sentences so that we can look back and understand everything clearly...```

- Use 👍 and 👎 to provide rough "counts" for how many people agree/disagree
- Use the counts to determine where to focus your experiments
- Use @mentions to assign owners, and transfer your experiments to GitHub for execution...

> **ProTip:**<br>
> Start the Slack Threads yourself and monitor the channel during the duration of the Retrospective. You'll want to encourage people to contribute to the threads so that the content is compact, easy to find, and helpful.

### MURAL

[MURAL](http://mural.ly){:target="_blank"} is the obvious choice for running distributed retrospectives, but can be challenging for those that are not familiar with it.
- Divide your board into three columns
- Drag and drop stickies into the appropriate columns
- Group together, look for patterns
- Use voting to decide which experiments to try first


### GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.ibm.com){:target="_blank"} is the place to track your experiments. Treat improvement as part of your ongoing work.

And remember, you don't have to hold a retrospective to improve. Every single one of us can (and should) be asking ourselves "how can we get better?" every single day...

> **Signs of Success**
> * Squads that hold Retrospectives regularly build a culture of Continuous Improvement
> * Squad Members are happier when they can make their own lives better
> * Squads that improve their own lives become examples for others to do the same

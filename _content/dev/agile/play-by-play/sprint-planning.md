# *THIS IS GITHUB/ZENHUB CENTRIC - NEEDS REWRITE FOR AHA->JIRA->CONFLUENCE->GITHUB

On the last day of the Sprint, hold a **Demo**, a **Retrospective**, then **Plan your next Sprint**

> **Who: Each Squad**
> **When: Last Day of the Sprint**
> Get started with this  **[(4 minute video)](http://agileacademy.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/standalone/iteration_planning/){:target="_blank"}** from the IBM Agile Academy about how to Plan for your next Sprint

Agile doesn't mean we don't plan. Offering Managers do an incredible amount of work to discover and define what we should build. Roadmaps are created that help guide us to our destination.

Sprint planning is our GPS to get us there and deal with the roadblocks along the way.

- Before each Sprint starts, look at what you accomplished last Sprint and assign a similar amount of work to your upcoming Sprint.
- Estimation tools like [Story Points in Zenhub](estimates-and-reports) allow you to apply T-Shirt style sizing to your work.
- Ensure you have a multi-disciplinary view of your Sprint. Everyone on your Squad attends and helps guide.

> **ProTip:** There's immense value in holding these three ceremonies on the _last day of the Sprint_ because it sets up a psychological line in the sand that helps our Squad members feel **Done**. This may sound trivial, but there have been long term studies that show that the best way to motivate people is by facilitating progress and enabling small wins.

Remember, Continuous Improvement is what we strive for...

> **Signs of Success**
> * Squads that plan for each Sprint have less re-work, get interrupted less, and get things done
> * Squads that plan consistently become predictable. Predictable Squads are valued higher in the organization

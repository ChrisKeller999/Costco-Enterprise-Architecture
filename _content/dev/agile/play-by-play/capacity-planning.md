Estimates are not precise and uncertain. Watson has varying levels of maturity, in terms of how we operate, and in terms of how we lead. Here is how we are moving toward a more mature model.

Product Teams should perform rapid, continous estimation and use Aha! to plan capacity from Quarter to Quarter.

## Estimates

T-shirt sizing and/or Planning Poker are easy methods to follow that don't waste precious time going deep on estimating the far away things.

### T-Shirt sizing

- Step one - review the prioritized plan and pick one that would be considered medium t-shirt sized, your anchor story. Note: "the plan" can be from the roadmap level down to the sprint level.
- Step two - now that you have your anchor then go through each story and ask if that story is much smaller, smaller, the same as, bigger, or much bigger than the anchor.
- Step three - equate T-shirt size to a story size number equivalent based on the level you are planning and/or on a previous average velocity

> **Pro Tip:**
> If the item is so unknowable that you can't determine based on prior work go HUGE. For example, if your capacity for the last quarter was 2000 points and you use T-shirt sizing, then make XL equivalent to between 50-80% of your known capacity.

### Planning Poker

- If you haven't done this already, build two tables of completed, representative work to use as a reference when estimating.
  - Step one - create one table for Sprint-sized work, and another for Epic-sized work, include the points in the table.
  - Step two - create one good example per point value (per time slice) should be enough to get going.
  - Step three - refer to these when sizing work and discussing differences

> **Pro Tip:**
> The "reference work" or "anchor story" trick helps speed planning poker to the extreme

## Capacity

At every level of the organization, whether it be at the personal level, the Squad level, or the Product level, there is a finite capacity available for work.

**We are people, not robots**, we must remember this as we make future plans.

Thankfully, we have tools that can help guide us towards understanding what can, and what can't be done within any given period of time.

### Capacity Planning in Aha!

Once you have estimates, you can use the Aha capacity planning capability to give you dates

- Step one - set the capacity limit in Aha based on your actual quarterly velocity
  - Add up the most recent quarter's worth of points from your Jira velocity charts
  - Add them to each Aha Release Target (by clicking on the word "Capacity" in the column)
- Step two - drag and drop your Aha Epics into the prioritized order (top is highest priority)
  Aha will draw a red line in the column to show you where you are at capacity
- Step three - drag anything below it to the next Quarter
- Step four - rinse, repeat

It's important to understand that estimates are intended to be able to help make **prioritization** and **tradeoff** decisions and **not to set due dates**. When we use the model above to make these estimates it will help us have better conversations about those due dates and deliverables.

Like everything else around here, we're trying to move the entire organization to continuous grooming, sizing, and planning (each are individual activities). There's still work to be done on all levels...

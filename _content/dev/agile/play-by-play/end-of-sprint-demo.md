title: End of Sprint Demo
---
On the last day of the **Sprint**, hold a **Demo**, a **Retrospective**, then **Plan your next Sprint**

> **Who: Whole Product Team**
> **When: Last Day of the Sprint**
> Get started with this  **[(5 minute video)](https://agileacademy.mybluemix.net/standalone/showcase/){:target="_blank"}** from the IBM Agile Academy about how to run an end of Sprint Demo


The **End of Sprint Demo** is the time to come together as a broader team to validate that what was planned for the sprint is what was achieved. For some team members the sprint was spent creating stories and writing code, others will have created architecture diagrams that lay the foundation for future work, while others still might have some preliminary user experience mock-ups to share with the broader team.

The **Iteration Manager** is responsible for the process of setting up the **End of Sprint Demo** and facilitating the session. They work with the **Offering Manager** who will help set the context by starting with a brief description of the business value delivered during the sprint. Then members of the **Development Team** will provide a demonstration of working code, a read out of an investigation story, an architectural diagram or other artifacts of the stories that were worked on in the sprint. Focusing on the business value helps keep the stakeholders engaged and is a good reminder to everyone of why we did what we did. Additional facilitation responsibilities include:

* Planning what will be said. It doesn't have to be a complete script, but knowing the highlights helps.
* Look at what the squad did over the last sprint. Identify stories that have been completed and use that as a starting point.
* Bring something visual to share. If there is a live demo of something ensure that your browser is open to the page and test it immediately before the meeting. Have a backup if things go wrong.
* Set time limits (5 minute slots and 10 minute slots work well) and make sure presenters adhere to time limits. The team may not be able to cover everything that was done that Sprint. That's fine.
* Post visuals and meeting notes.

After the Demo, have lunch as a team then hold a Retrospective...

> **Signs of Success**
> * Your Squad Members feel a sense of pride in showcasing what they've accomplished.
> * Your organization better understands what work is being done.
> * You ensure that the right work is being done in the right order.
> * Offering Management, Design, and Engineering are on the same page.

>The **Sprint Plan** and the **End of Sprint Demo** are the bookends to your sprint.

title: Product Grooming
---

# *THIS IS GITHUB/ZENHUB CENTRIC - NEEDS REWRITE FOR AHA->JIRA->CONFLUENCE->GITHUB

Every week, the Product Leadership team comes together for Continuous Product Grooming. Here's the flow:

* Describe
* Size (within one week)
* Prioritze
* Repeat

> **Who:** Offering Manager, Development Leader, Design Leader, Architect - Squad Leaders attend only when they are blocked
> **When:** Preferably Daily, but at least weekly


## Describe (10 Minutes)
- The Offering Manager brings the list of new Ideas / Epics / Hills
- Each item must have Acceptance Criteria so that the Product Leadership Team doesn't waste time debating what things mean
- They review each item with the Product Leadership Team
- The Product Leadership team asks questions, provides feedback, any concerns are written down in the Aha item
- This exercise is time-boxed to 1 minute per idea, maximum of 10 minutes.

## Size (10 minutes)
- The Development Leader reviews the sizing done for each item
- The Product Leadership team asks questions, provides feedback, any concerns are written down in the Aha item
- Agreed upon Sizing is added to the Aha item
- Ideas are promoted to Epic status
- The Development Leader, Design Leader, and Architect take the list of new items back to the Squads and run Planning Poker Sessions. The output of those sessions will be reviewed at the next Product Grooming Session

## Prioritize (10 minutes)
- The Product Leadership team prioritizes the sized Epics and assigns them to the appropriate Quarter in Aha
- If the Epic is going to be worked on in the next Quarter, send it to ZenHub and have the Squads start deconstructing the work.

## Repeat
- If you can't get through all of the items that need to be reviewed, schedule another Product Grooming Session for the next day, do not extend the meeting.
- Forcing the time-boxing will prevent the Product Leadership Team from getting into the weeds.

> **Signs of Success**
> * Squads have the information they need to understand their work.
> * Product Leadership Team is able to adjust priorities continuously to react to changes in the market
> * Offering Management, Design, and Engineering are on the same page.

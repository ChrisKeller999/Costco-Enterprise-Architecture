title: Whole Team Standup
---

# *THIS IS GITHUB/ZENHUB CENTRIC - NEEDS REWRITE FOR AHA->JIRA->CONFLUENCE->GITHUB

> **Who: Squad Leaders**
> **When: Every Week**

**15 Minute Daily Standups** are key to aligning our Squads and breaking bottlenecks on a daily basis. While Squads must be capable of owning a mission from thought to production, the **whole team** must come together on a regular cadence to align each of the Squads. This is called the "Whole Team Standup" and should happen at least once a week (Whole Team Standup is the modern name for a "Scrum of Scrums").

### Running the session
- The **Release Manager** will typically run the Whole Team Standup
- The **Release Manager** brings up the **ZenHub** Board and filters by:
    - The current Sprint
    - The current Squad
- Each Squad Leader will then say:
    - What closed this week
    - What will be done next week
    - List the blockers

> **ProTip:** While it might not be obvious, it helps to assign your **Epics** to the current Sprint so you can use the "Filter by this Epic" button so you can quickly focus on the the work being done for that Epic. You can also use the Whole Team Standup to keep your board up to date...

While your team can elect to have a Whole Team Standup as often as they see fit, once a week should be considered the minimum for anyone in Watson.

> **Signs of Success**
> * Squads have the information they need to understand their work.
> * Blockers and dependencies are brought to light and can then be worked on.
> * Offering Management, Design, and Engineering are on the same page.

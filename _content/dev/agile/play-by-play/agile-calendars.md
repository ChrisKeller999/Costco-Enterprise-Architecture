Life moves pretty fast. Agile helps teams keep up. To allow our teams to welcome changing requirements, [even late in development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html){:target="_blank"}, we work in short iterations called Sprints. [(4 minute video)](http://agileacademy.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/standalone/iteration_zero/){:target="_blank"}

- 1 or 2 week Sprints are the key to enabling course correction
- On the last day of the Sprint, we have a **Demo**, **Retrospective** and then we **Plan** for our next Sprint
- Ensure your Product Team **minimizes regularly scheduled meetings** by adopting a **Minimal Meeting Load**

## One Week Sprint Calendar

The following shows a calendar that _most_ Squad Members can start with.

Add to this some regular activies like dealing with Email/Slack/Calendar, eating lunch, and working on Techincal Vitality activies, and you still have a calendar **designed** to give you big blocks of time:

Ensuring your Squad Members have big blocks of **uninterrupted** time is vital to allowing them to get into states of **deep work** or even achieving **flow**.

## One Week Sprint Calendar (Product Leadership Team)

The following shows a calendar that _most_ Product Leaders can start with.

The **primary** addition to their calendar is the [**Daily Product Grooming**](../product-grooming).

Notice that it's held right after Squads hold their Standups. This allows a **Squad Leader** to join the **Daily Product Grooming** session to and raise blockers.

## Two Week Sprint Calendar

If your Product works in two week Sprints, we add a "Whole Team Standup" on the first Friday of the Sprint.

The second week of the Sprint is exactly like the one week Sprint Calendar.

> **Signs of Success**
> * Your Squad Members spend more time Designing, Coding, and Deploying, than they do sitting in Meetings (measure this).
> * Your Velocity goes up over time (look for an upward sloping Velocity Report)
> * You no longer hear Squad Members state they're in too many meetings during your Retrospectives

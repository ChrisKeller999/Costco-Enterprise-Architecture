At Watson Health we work in multi-disciplinary teams and apply Agile, Design Thinking and Human-Centered Design approach in a regulated environment. This section will provide high level overview of key practices and provide guidelines for requirements writing.

## Practices in Action
- Offering Management - What we build
- Agile - Adapt to change & deliver value per iteration
- QMS - Practices to deliver quality under regulation
- Design Thinking - Human-centered approach

### Offering Management (OM)
Offering Management is an approach to defining offerings used within IBM. It takes into account market and business needs and aims to allow offerings to be delivered incrementally.

### Agile
Agile is a methodology for the creative development process that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism into the delivery of the finished product. Agile assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.

### Quality Management System (QMS)
QMS is the set of processes focusing on regulatory requirements, patient safety, meeting needs and ensuring satisfaction with our solutions. The Watson Health Quality Management System (QMS) is a collection of business processes WH will follow so that we stay focused on complying with regulatory requirements, ensuring patient safety, consistently meeting our customer’s needs and making sure they are satisfied with the solutions we’re offering. The focus on meeting regulatory needs means that we have to produce specific artifacts and have identified processes, but this does not mean that we follow a waterfall process.
This is so important for us as an industry leader, and it shows our commitment to developing products that meet the highest quality standards.

### Design Thinking
IBM Design Thinking (DT) is human centred design  approach for problem solving. It focuses on human needs and value. IBM Design Thinking has three major parts:
The Principles: A frame to see problems and solutions from a new point of view.
The Loop: A behavioral model to understand users’ needs and deliver outcomes continuously.
The Keys: Techniques to scale your practice to complex problems and complex teams.

### Agile & Design Thinking Key Terms
**Hills:** High level human centered business objectives. A Hill is a statement of intent, written as meaningful user outcome. The Hill identifies the users who will consume the value (Who), describes an outcome in user–centric language (What), and formulates a meaningful user outcome (Wow).
**Technical Foundation:** Technical Foundation supports cross-cutting quality, serviceability, and consumability requirements. Technical Foundation is not a Hill, but rather an investment made towards development work.
**Epics:** An epic captures a large body of work. It is a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. It may take several sprints to complete an epic. An epic can span more than one project, if multiple projects are included in the board to which the epic belongs.
**User Stories:** A user story is a short description of a desired functionality requirement features. User stories are written from the perspective of an end user.

### FDA Key Terms
FDA calls out User Needs, Design Input, Design Output and Medical Device, however it does not call out levels of requirements.
- Design Input: (FDA) the physical and performance requirements of a device that are used as a basis for device design.
- Design Output: (FDA) the results of a design effort at each design phase and at the end of the total design effort.
- User Needs: The needs, expressed or otherwise, of users of the device.
- Intended Use: The objective intent of the manufacturer regarding the use of a product, process or service as reflected in the specifications, instructions and information provided by the manufacturer.

## Hills
Hills are high level requirements & define the problem or need.
**Written by:** Offering Management with collaboration from Design lead, Technical leads, and other stakeholders as needed.

Align with IBM Design Thinking
- Who – Specific user or class of users
- What – Specific user enablement
- Wow – Specific & differentiating value to the user (often, but not always, performance)

**Recommended Format:**
WHO can/able to…
WHAT…. [high level] and/within/by…
WOW [uniqueness, great value]

## Epics
Epics are the next layer of high level requirements that focus on the problem  One or more scenarios (epics) is needed to achieve the Hill
**Written by:** Collaboratively by the technical leads, OM and Design are reviewers.

Intended Use
- Reflective of a scenario
- Provides value (what) to the user (who)
- Aids in organization & grouping of detailed requirements

**Recommended Format:**
As a WHO
I need the ability to [do] WHAT
in order to [goal/value] WHY

## Stories
Requirements Stories are detailed requirements that focus on the solution
One or more scenarios (epics) is needed to achieve the Hill
**Written by:** Technical Leads and Squad leads with collaboration with team members, as needed

Intended Use
- Lists what the system will do to provide value (what) to the user (who)
- Includes Acceptance Criteria that is used to verify the planned solution was provided

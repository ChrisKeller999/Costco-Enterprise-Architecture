We call the way we organize people and roles IBM **Squad Thinking**. Everything we do is here to support our Squad Members. Here's how it works...

<a name="markets"></a>

## Our Segments

The **Watson Health Organization** is made up of different market **Markets**. Our current Markets are Payer, Provider, Life Sciences, Oncology & Genomics, Government Health & Human Services. We also have offerings that cross market Segments such as the Watson Platform for Health and the VBC Foundation.  Each Segment has a **Market Leader** and one or more **Leadership Teams**.

## The Leadership Team

<img src="https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/agileplaybook/agile-leadership-team.svg" width="200px" align="right" alt="agile leadership team">

The **Leadership Team** typically consists of a **Development Leader**, a **Offering Manager**, a **Design Leader** and an **Architect**. These four work together to define the backlog and guide the overall project. Together, they are responsible for:

* Defining Hills
* Decomposing Hills into Epics
* Assigning Epics to Releases
* Assigning Epics to Squads
* Managing the overall release plan

> **ProTip:** Your **Offering Manager** is _usually_ synonymous with a **Senior Offering Manager** (using traditional IBM-specific terms)

## Tribes

<img src="https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/agileplaybook/tribe-graphic.svg" width="300px" align="right" alt="tribe graphic">
Tribe is another term we've borrowed from Spotify. Tribes are groups of Products / Services or Projects aligned around common Goals.

Tribes include team members from Development, Offering Management, and Design.  Other disciplines are also present in the Tribe, such as Marketing, Finance, Support, etc., but they usually don't organize into the squads.

The Tribe is supported by a **Leadership Team** that prioritizes and assigns Epics across all squads.

## Products / Offerings / Services

Each Tribe typically supports a number of Products / Offerings, Services or Projects within it that are aligned around common Goals. They have one or more Squads. A Product / Offering / Service is sold, while a Project is not currently sold (though may be in the future).

<a name="release-manager"></a>

## Release Managers

Working *with* the **Leadership Team** at the Product / Offering / Service level are our **Release Managers**.
* Each **Product** should have a **Release Manager**. They work with the **Squads** on a _daily basis_ to ensure that the Sprint goals are being met. They **break bottlenecks**, align our Squads and drive the execution of our delivery plan.

> **Release Managers** are the enablers, accelerators and guardians of the various processes for the products they support.
> Release Managers are the **Guardians of the Process** which means that they continually look at how we can do things better and ensure we are following the existing processes.

Release Managers are **laser focused** on ensuring we can **execute** on our **delivery plans and timelines** and they do this in three key areas:

**Compliance**

If you've never heard of the *Offering Deliverables Catalog*, or had to make an update to *Clearing House*, or had to deal with *Disaster Recovery* process or you've never heard of the *OMD process*, you can **thank your Release Manager**. No, really, bring them coffee or chocolate or balloons. They deserve your thanks because they are **shielding you** from very time consuming but necessary component of our releases. Release Managers have a never ending responsibility to be **aware of any and all compliance related activities that may impact a timeline** of a particular feature or capability. They are responsible for knowing exactly what it takes to get a product from an experimental to a GA service in Cloud. If you'd like to learn more about the various compliance requirements that Release Managers deal with here are a few links that will give you a taste or a headache of all of the things that they are responsible for knowing about to help you get your products out the door:

**Communication and Planning**

Release Managers work with the product leadership team to ensure that the communication and planning is as effective and efficient as it can be. They are the **enablers** who look across teams to **identify** where there are **dependencies** and advise Offering Managers on prioritization in relations to those dependencies. Please **help your Release Manager** by letting them know as early as possible when you plan to GA a product or would like to make changes to pricing or plans. They can help you understand the timeline of the process, so you can plan the release and announcements accordingly.

**Agile Process**

Release Managers help with **problem solving** and are part of the Leadership Team that can help remove blockers and try to keep the noise of competing priorities and demands. They are the enforcers of the process. Once the product team has agreed to operate in alignment with Agile process they can help **reinforce those practices and principles** and advise when we are out of alignment.

## Iteration Managers

Iteration managers are key to helping squads **Accelerate** their development by **Removing Impediments**, **Managing the Iteration** and embodying **Servant Leadership**.

Iteration managers **carry water and remove boulders for the squads**.

## Squads

> **IBM Agile Academy** - Get started with a **[5 minute video about Squads](http://agileacademy.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/standalone/cross-functional_teams/){:target="_blank"}**

<img src="https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/agileplaybook/squad-structure.svg" width="300px" align="right" alt="squad structure">
A Squad is a small, cross-functional, self-organizing team who has end-to-end responsibility for the stuff they build, including: Design, Development, Documentation, Quality, Performance, and Delivery. A Squad leader's job is to communicate what needs to be solved and why, then Squads collaborate to find the best solution. Even though each Squad has its own mission, they need to be aligned with product strategy, company priorities, and other Squads. Squads are assigned Epics in their tracker by the **Leadership Team**. The Squad will decompose the highest priority Epics into Stories (just focusing on the next few Sprints) and keep their board up to date as those Stories progress from thought to production. Don't write six monthsâ€™ worth of Stories, your mission will change before you know it!


Ideally, a well-performing Squad:

* Is **small**, no bigger than **10 people**
* Is **co-located** in the same **physical space** or **timezone**
* Includes Designers, Developers, and Offering Management
* [Practices **team ceremonies**](play-by-play)
* Is **aligned** with other Squads
* Is **empowered** to put their work **into production**
* Is **capability-focused**
* Works **autonomously**
* Makes decisions **independently**, rather than by committee or decree
* **Minimizes** handoffs and waiting

Together, the Squad will:

* Refine Epics into Stories
* Estimate Story level of effort
* Plan their own Sprints
* Execute work in Sprints as a cross-functional team

Squads **thrive** when they have a **mission**, are **co-located**, **multi-disciplinary**, and **small**.

**Most people** should be on **one** and **only one** Squad. This should be followed unless there are _extreme_ resource issues requiring someone to split focus on multiple missions (e.g. not enough Designers working on a Product).

**Offering Managers** will typically be a **Part Time** Squad member, helping during Grooming and Planning. Offering Managers typically work with **multiple Squads**.


## Guilds

Supporting our Segments, Squads, and Tribes are our Guilds. The Guild concept (like Tribes and Squads) come to us from the fine folks at Spotify and are how we maintain alignment and drive efficiency across the entire Watson Health organization. Guilds are organized around disciplines (like the Engineering Guild, the Offering Management Guild). Each Guild is made up of members from all of our Segments. Each Guild has one or more Slack channels, has defined leaders, and is **the** source for discipline-based best practices. The Agile Transformation Guild creates Playbooks for each Segment and works with Squads to adopt a culture of Continuous Improvement.

## Chapters

And finally, we come to Chapters. A Chapter is just like a Guild, but typically only works within a Tribe or Location. A Guild is cross-Tribe / cross-Location. A Chapter will typically organize local brown bag sessions, tech talks, or other lab-based events...

## Extended Team Roles and Ceremonies...

Each and every Product Team is supported by a large number of **extended team members**. Here's an overview of the roles and ceremonies that happen on a continuous basis.

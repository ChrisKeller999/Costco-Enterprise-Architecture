## Getting Organized (Tools)

- **[Aha!](../../../tools/aha/)** is the home for everything related your **business strategy**, your **user personas**, and your **product roadmap**. Your **Offering Manager** lives in Aha! each and every day.
- **[Jira](../../../tools/jira/)** allows your Squads to plan and track their work in the **same place** they deliver their code.
- **[Confluence](../../../tools/confluence/)** is the collaboration space, where your Squad can create, organize and discuss work as well as store key documents for future reference.

As Aha! is shared with other IBM organizations, the **Watson Health Segment** has been created.
Within the Watson Health Segment the various Watson Health Markets and Offering Lines (MMTs and OTs) have been setup.

* **Product** = **Offering** is a product, service or combination of a both that is is then sold to an end customer.
* **Product Line** = **Offering Line** is a grouping of either offerings or other offering lines.

Teams in Watson follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/){:target="_blank"} when delivering code. Fork & Clone > [Branch](branching) > Commit > Pull Request. Pull Requests are reviewed [**and merged**](merging) by another Squad Member so we can ensure we comply with [**separation of duties**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties){:target="_blank"} rules.

This page will focus on organizational Best Practices around the last part of the flow: Merging.

## The Rule

**Never merge your own work.**

It's really as simple as that.

All Watson Squad Members must have someone else review and merge their work.

Squad Members must never merge their own work and put it into Production.

## Overall Strategy

Why? Several reasons.

- It's been proven time and time again that Code Reviews prevent defects from entering our Systems.
- Taking responsibility for merging someone else's work motivates you to perform a more thoughtful review.
- It provides the lowest-cost way possible to implement **separation of duties** controls into our workflow **without** negatively impacting our Squad Members.
- **Separation of Duties** is a non-negotiable requirement for selling software and services in regulated industries.

## What it's not

- This is not a review board
- This is not a heavyweight process
- This does not take control away from the hands of the Squad Members
- This doesn't require anything other than following [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/){:target="_blank"}
- This does not drastically change how the **vast majority** of Squads have already been working

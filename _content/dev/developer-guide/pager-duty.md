## Overview

PagerDuty is an incident management platform that provides reliable incident alerting via **Slack**, email, push, SMS, and phone, as well as automatic escalations, on-call scheduling, and other functionality to help teams detect and fix infrastructure problems quickly.

A description of PagerDuty can be found here:
<https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us>

## PagerDuty access

## Slack Integration

Members of the IBM Watson Slack Workspace can now set up the **updated** PagerDuty Integration without help from an Administrator.

The **updated** PagerDuty Integration allows you to acknowledge (and take ownership) of Incidents right from your Slack Channel. This requires a one time linking of your Slack and PagerDuty accounts, just follow the prompts, it's super easy.

> **ProTip**
> If you used the "old" PagerDuty Notification with your Slack Channel, you'll need to remove your old configuration after you set up the new one. You can find your **previous** integration in the list found [here](https://ibm-watson.slack.com/apps/A0F81FMQW-pagerduty-notifications?page=1){:target="_blank"}

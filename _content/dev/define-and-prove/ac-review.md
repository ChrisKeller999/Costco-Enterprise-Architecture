## What is the Architecture Council?
[The Architecture Council](../../common-services/definition-process/#architecture-council) is made up of key architecture and development leaders who have the skills and background to assess recommendations for Watson Health Common Services and are ultimately the responsible for the final disposition of whether a service should be made into a common service.

## How do I get started?
In order for the Architecture Council to effectively review a service for technical viability as a WH Common Service, it is imperative that the [WH Common Services Process](../../common-services/index/) be reviewed, and that an [Initial High-Level Architecture](../initial-hl-architecture/), which is an earlier step in the Define and Prove phase of the WH Development Process.

The high-level architecture, among other key aspects needed for the Architecture Council to perform a review, need to be documented by the Offering Manager in a [Definition Package](../../../om/define-and-prove/start-cs-def-package/), which should have also been started earlier in this phase of the WH Development Process.

Steps 1 through 6 below should have been completed in previous process flow steps in the WH Development Process. However they are documented below since these steps are of particular relevance to the AC Review.

### Step by step
1. Collect all current architectural design documentation:
    1. [Initial High-Level Architecture](../initial-hl-architecture/)
    2. Key Use Cases should have been documented as part of the [Solution Architecture](../begin-sol-arch/) task.
2. Collect any documented [Technical Foundation](../doc-tech-foundation) and other [operational](../op-hello-world/) material.
3. Collect any [Wireframes](../../../design/define-and-prove/design-wireframe-prototype/) and [Design Experience Architecture](../../../design/define-and-prove/doc-exp-arch/).
4. Collect any documented requirements such as [Hills](../../../om/define-and-prove/create-new-hills/) and [Epics](../../../om/define-and-prove/develop-epics-groom-backlog/).
5. Collect any regulatory and compliance assessment results (e.g. [GDPR](../../../compliance/define-and-prove/gdpr-triage/), [HIPAA](../../../compliance/define-and-prove/hipaa-assessment/), [PSRA](../../../compliance/define-and-prove/psra-assessment/)) and the result of a [GxP Architectural Assessment](../assess-hl-arch-gxp/)
6. Incorporate all of the above into the [Definition Package](../../../om/define-and-prove/start-cs-def-package/).
7. Request an Architectural Council Review, and provide the Definition Package.
    1. The AC Review will evaluate if the required documentation is sufficient to give a picture of the architectural risks, operational issues, changes needed to an existing solution, and so on that will be required to either develop a new WH Common Service, or refactor an existing service to become a WH Common Service.
    2. The AC Review could determine that the risks are too high to proceed as a WH Common Service, in which case a suitable alternate deployment and usage scenario should be suggested that will not incur significant financial risk.
8. The outcome of the AC Review should be documented and recorded in Jira and Confluence **(_VIDEO_)**

## Development Tools Listed in the Product Development Plan (PDP)

Per the GxP assessment (WH_QMS_SOP_0005 v3.0), an Offering's tools must listed in the PDP for all Offerings at WH.

These tools, per Design Control SOP (WH_QMS_SOP_0002), are all automated/computerized system tools used to design, run  tests, document evidence of control, sign electronically, and aid any other processes  shall be subject to assessment per the Master Regulatory Asset Planning SOP WH_QMS_SOP_0023.

There is no difference in the rigor or level of detail of the tools listed in the PDPs for Offerings that are:

GxP:  Subject to GxP regulations (WH_QMS_SOP_0005; see section 6.2.3)
- For MRAP: The tools listed in PDPs for Offerings are added to the MRAP for inventory purposes. Each tool will be GxP  Assessed. Validation, as applicable, will be performed to ensure the tool operates as intended.

GxPLite:  May become subject to GxP regulations (WH_QMS_SOP_0005; see section 6.2.4)
- For MRAP:  The tools listed in PDPs for Offerings are added to the MRAP for inventory purposes. Each tool will be GxP Assessed. Validation, as applicable, will not be actioned at this point of time, unless needed.

Non-GxP:  Not subject to GxP regulations (WH_QMS_SOP_0005; see section 6.2.5)
- For MRAP:  For Offerings that are not subject to GxP regulations, there is no requirement to add tools to MRAP.

### Step by step
1. MRAP (Master Regulatory Asset Plan) is the the process used by the tools validation team to record, track and report tool inventory within Watson Health.
2. MRAP relies on the PDP (Product development plan) as the true source of tools used against a regulated offering.
3. The author of the PDP must check [MRAP inventory](https://ibmwh.clm.ibmcloud.com/ccm/web/projects/WH%20Master%20Regulatory%20Asset%20Planning#action=com.ibm.team.dashboard.viewDashboard&tab=_28){:target="_blank"} to ensure tools defined in the PDP document are in [MRAP inventory](https://ibmwh.clm.ibmcloud.com/ccm/web/projects/WH%20Master%20Regulatory%20Asset%20Planning#action=com.ibm.team.dashboard.viewDashboard&tab=_28){:target="_blank"}
4. Tools which are marked active available in MRAP have been assessed and validated (as applicable) and are available for use.
5. Where a tool listed on the PDP is not in MRAP, has delta in version or intended use, a tool request is required to [submit tool to inventory](https://ibmwh.clm.ibmcloud.com/ccm/web/projects/WH%20Master%20Regulatory%20Asset%20Planning#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.newWorkItem&type=com.wh.team.workitem.workitemType.mrapAsset&ts=15451326540040){:target="_blank"}

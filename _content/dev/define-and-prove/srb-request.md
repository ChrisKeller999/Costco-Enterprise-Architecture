## Security Review Board - Request for Review
At this point, it is necessary to formally request a review by the Security Review Board in order to review the architectural choices as well as help to identify any security issues early in the design process. The Release Manager is responsible for downloading all templates, filling them out, and posting them back to the correct location to initiate the SRB Process.

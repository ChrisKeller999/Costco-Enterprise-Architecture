## Technical Foundation Hills and Epics
Technical Foundation are Non-Functional Hills and Epics that define qualities of a service such as performance targets, security, data requirements, and so forth. These Technical Foundation requirements are generally documented by the Development Leads and the Architect.

## How do I get started?
During the [initial high-level architecture task](../initial-hl-architecture/) task, [Cognitive Architect](../../../tools/ca/) was used to start capturing architectural concepts and diagrams. During the high-level architecture tasks, [Cognitive Architect](../../../tools/ca/) should have been used to also start capturing Non-Functional requirements is response to the high-level architecture work. Continue to iterate on the high-level architecture and capture NFR's in this fashion. Then, use these NFR's to create Technical Foundation Hills and Epics in [Aha!](../../../tools/aha/).

### Step by step
1. Refine Technical Foundation (NFR) Hills and Epics in [Cognitive Architect](../../../tools/ca/) as Non-Functional Requirements until you are satisfied you have a good cross-section of the required non-functional focus.
2. Examine any Architectural Decisions that may produce further Technical Foundation requirements.
3. Define, in [Aha!](../../../tools/aha/), Hills and Epics that represent the NFR's documented in [Cognitive Architect](../../../tools/ca/).

## Before You Begin

For each Project Offering in the Watson Health Jira Solution, a structured set
of custom pages are created in Confluence for *Market Opportunity & Approach*, *Offering Releases* which includes *Define & Prove* as well as *Build & Deliver*, and *Sense & Respond*, which aligns with the [Offering Management (OM) Wheel](../../../foundation/why/index/).

With view and edit permissions, an Author can attach artifacts to the appropriate page. Once an artifact is attached, the Author can initiate a Review
and/or an Approval workflow on the artifact.

**Applicable role(s):** An Author with view and edit capabilities in Confluence.

**Procedure**

1.  The Author navigates to the appropriate Confluence page in the Page Tree where the artifact type will reside. For example, locate the Release Ask/Plan artifact on the Project Management page within the *Define & Prove* section of Offering Releases.

1.  Before the Author attaches the desired artifact to the appropriate Artifacts page in the Uploaded Artifacts section, the Author must carefully determine the *<u>filename</u>* of the artifact.
  >   **IMPORTANT TIP**: **Before** attaching the artifact to a specific Artifacts page, it is important to determine the *filename* of the artifact. Document versioning is dependent on the *filename* of the document.
  >   Every artifact that is uploaded to a Confluence page automatically generates a version of itself. The first time you upload a document, the system assigns this document as Version 1. If you upload an updated document with the same filename, the system up versions the version number to Version 2.
  >   Each upload of a document to the system with the same filename up-versions the document version number. However, if you change the filename of the document and upload the document to Confluence, the version number of this document (with a different filename) is set to Version 1.
  >   So, choose your document filenames thoughtfully, as you must keep the same *filename* of your document to continue document versioning on the same document.

1.  The Author attaches the desired artifact to the appropriate Artifacts page in the Uploaded Artifacts section. Drag and drop file or use Browse to attach files. Any type document format can be added to the Confluence page. The Uploaded Artifacts section displays information about the attached artifacts, including version history information.

**What to do next**

The document can be readied for a review. See [Reviewing Artifacts in Confluence](../confl_reviewing_artifacts/).

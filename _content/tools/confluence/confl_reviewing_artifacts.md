# DRAFT

## Before You Begin

For each Project Offering, a structured set of pages are created in Confluence
for *Market Opportunity & Approach*, *Offering Releases* which includes *Define
& Prove* as well as *Build & Deliver*, and *Sense & Respond*, which aligns with the [Offering Management (OM) Wheel](../../../foundation/why/index/).

Once an artifact is attached to the appropriate page, the Author can initiate a Review on the artifact.

**Applicable role(s):**

-   Author with view and edit capabilities in Confluence.
-   Reviewer with view and edit capabilities in Confluence.

**Procedure**

1.  The Author navigates to the appropriate Confluence page in the Page Tree where the artifact type resides. For example, locate the Release Ask/Plan artifact on the Project Management page within the *Define & Prove* section of Offering Releases.

    ![Define and Prove, Project Management, Release Ask Plan](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_dp_projmgmt_relask_b.png "Define and Prove, Project Management, Release Ask Plan")

1.  The Author determines the document is ready for review and ensures the “ready for review” document is attached using the *<u>same</u>* filename.

    >   **IMPORTANT TIP**:  **Before** attaching the artifact to a specific Artifacts page, it is important to determine the *filename* of the artifact. Document versioning is dependent on the *filename* of the document.
    >   Every artifact that is uploaded to a Confluence page automatically generates a version of itself. The first time you upload a document, the system assigns this document as Version 1. If you upload an updated document with the same filename, the system up versions the version number to Version 2.
    >   Each upload of a document to the system with the same filename up-versions the document version number. However, if you change the filename of the document and upload the document to Confluence, the version number of this document (with a different filename) is set to Version 1.
    >   So, choose your document filenames thoughtfully, as you must keep the *<u>same filename </u>* of your document to continue document versioning on the same document.

1.  The Author clicks **Add Review/Approval** on the Artifacts page.

    ![Add DPP Review/Approval](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_add_dpp_reviewapproval.png "Add DPP Review/Approval")

1.  From the WH Reviews & Approvals dialog, specify the following information:

    a. Name of the Review - This is a free text field.
    >   **Tip**: Include “Review” as part of the name.

    b.  Artifact for review – From the drop-down menu, select the attached document for review.

    c.  Select WH Quality Review (the default).

    ![WH Reviews and Approvals Wizard page](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_reviewapprove_wizard.png "WH Reviews and Approvals Wizard page")

1.  Click **Create**. This defines the specified review workflow for the
    specified artifact. The review workflow applies for the most current version
    (see version history) of the artifact.

1.  The Author of the review can view the named Review from the Page Tree
    structure in the left navigation as a sub-page to the Artifacts page. The
    following screen capture illustrates:

    1.  The named Review in the Page Tree
    2.  The status of the Review
    3.  This is a WH Quality Artifact Review
    4.  The Artifact under Review
    5.  The status of the Review

1.  The Author of the review clicks **Draft** (item 2) to work with the review. The Author can Cancel the review or change the status to “In Progress”. If the review is cancelled, the named review is not deleted, and it displays as cancelled. To progress the Review, the Author selects “In Progress”, adds an optional comment, and clicks **Submit**. Comments added to the review workflow are captured and displayed with the Review Activity information.

1.  For this Review, the Author clicks **Add reviewer** to add one or more reviewers.

    **IMPORTANT**: The Author of the Review is the one that initiates the Review workflow. The Author of a Review (or Approval) cannot participate as a Reviewer (or Approver). Once Reviewers are assigned, the reviews occur in parallel, meaning that all Reviewers receive their review assignment simultaneously.

    > **Tip:** When you have multiple browser pages open, such as the Assign Reviewers page and the Artifact Review page, be sure to refresh the individual browser pages so that the information you are viewing is the most current.

1.  The Author of the Review can view information about the review by locating
    the named Review from the Page Tree structure. The following screen capture
    illustrates:

    1. The named Review in the Page Tree
    2. The title of the Review
    3. The status of the Review
    4. This is a WH Quality Artifact Review.
    5. The Artifact under Review
    6. Information about the Artifact Review
    7. Activity Information about the Artifact Review – Note the participants and the pending action for the reviewer.
<br>
    ![Review page - In Progress](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_review_relask_inprogress.png "Review page - In Progress")

1.  The Reviewer of the Artifact receives an email notification of the review
    assignment. The review assignment is also displayed on the Reviewer’s
    Confluence dashboard page under **My Comala Workflows Tasks**. Comala is a
    plug-in to Confluence which handles reviews and approvals.

2.  The Reviewer clicks the link for the Review to open the Review page.

3.  From the named Review page, you can see from (1) that this is a WH Quality
    Artifact Review for the specified artifact. To open the Quality Review
    dialog, the Reviewer clicks the **In Progress** link as illustrated in (2).

    ![Review page for Reviewer](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_reviewer_opens_assignment.png "Review page for Reviewer")

1.  From within the Quality Review dialog, the Reviewer enters a Comment
    (required field) and clicks either **Approve** or **Reject**. Comments added
    to the review workflow are captured and displayed with the Review Activity
    information.

    ![Reviewer response](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_reviewer_responds.png "Reviewer response")

    **Important:** Even though this is a review workflow, the Reviewer must either Approve or Reject the document under Review. The Reviewer must provide a comment in the Quality Review dialogue. This comment applies to the activity of reviewing the artifact. If the Reviewer wants to provide detailed comments within a copy of the document to the Author, the Reviewer can share their comments directly with the Author of the Review outside of the review workflow. The Reviewer cannot attach an updated document which includes their comments to the Artifact Review. The document in the Review workflow cannot be altered by any individual or the system.

1.  Once the Reviewer clicks **Approve** or **Reject** for the review, the
    Activity section of the named Review page reflects the approval or rejection
    of the document for the Reviewer.

    ![Reviewer approves](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_reviewer_approves.png "Reviewer approves")

    Note:
    -   If one Reviewer rejects the document, the review workflow is rejected, and the status of the Review is “Rejected”.
    -   After all assigned Reviewers approve the document, the review workflow is approved, and the status of the Review is “Approved”.

1.  Once the Review is completed, the Activity panel of the named Review page displays the information about the review for the artifact. The time stamps values reflect time stamps of the server.

    ![Review page - Approved](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_review_relask_approved.png "Review page - Approved")

1.  (Optional) The Author of the Review can optionally view a detailed audit
    trail or log of the Review by viewing the Activity Log for the Review. To
    view the Activity Report, complete the following steps:

    1.  Locate the named Review page. You can locate the link to the named
        Review page from the Artifacts page.
    2.  Click the status link.
    3.  Click the 3 dots icon for more options.

Confluence Enterprise is our Watson Health document management solution integrated with Jira.

Confluence provides a single place to store documentation and tie it to requirements, process flows, design and issues. It also provides a comprehensive collaboration capability that allows our teams to provide feedback on documentation and edit collaboratively.

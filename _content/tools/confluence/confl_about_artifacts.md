## Before You Begin

Confluence is a collaborative, content management system that is integrated with the WH Jira Solution for the storage and maintenance of project offering documentation that is quality controlled and non-quality controlled. With the right permissions, you can contribute, collaborate and share knowledge and manage documents across teams.

When a Project Offering is added to the WH Jira Solution, a structured set of pages are created in Confluence for *Market Opportunity & Approach*, *Offering Releases* which includes *Define & Prove* as well as *Build & Deliver*, and *Sense & Respond*, which aligns with the [Offering Management (OM) Wheel](../../../foundation/why/index/).

As such, it is important that you understand which type of information you are working with and which category of the Offering Wheel the information applies
for.

-   *Market Opportunity & Approach* (MOA) page – Designed to hold MOA artifacts,
    such as Market Analysis and Prioritization, GxP Assessments or Market Opportunity Playback, to this page.

-   *Offering Releases* page – For a specific release of a Project Offering, the phases of the   OM Wheel that apply are:
    -   *Define & Prove*

    -   *Build & Deliver*
  <br>![Build & Deliver Pages](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/confluence/confl_buildanddeliver.png "Build & Deliver Pages")

    For each Project Offering in the Watson Health Jira Solution, the system will create custom pages that are organized by release for *Define & Prove* and *Build & Deliver* pages. These pages offer a “dashboard” view of the applicable artifacts for the Offering Release phase. To work (edit/modify) these pages, the Author must follow and apply appropriate WH process and QMS process to complete release-specific artifacts on release-specific pages.

  -   *Sense & Respond* page – Designed to hold Offering level retrospectives to
    aid Offering Management in ensuring market viability of Offering Features
    from release to release.

After attaching appropriate artifacts to the appropriate pages within the Page Tree, the documents can be reviewed.

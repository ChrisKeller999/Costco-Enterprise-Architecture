# DRAFT

## Before You Begin
The Watson Health Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution is a system which integrates Aha!, Jira, Xray Test Management, Confluence, and GitHub to create an end-to-end solution for WH Offerings to manage requirements, develop and test approved requirements, and enable traceability across key elements of the system.

The Onboarding Request for a Project Offering initiates the request to add and setup the solution and its components for use by the Project Offering.

Use the [onboarding request form](https://vbc-jira.watson-health.ibm.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=18878&issuetype=12){:target="_blank"} to initiate the request.

**Applicable Role(s):**  Offering Manager<br>
<small>** The Offering Manager that completes and submits the Onboarding Request Form for a Project Offering must have access to the WH Jira Solution.</small>

## Procedure

1. Open the [onboarding request form](https://vbc-jira.watson-health.ibm.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=18878&issuetype=12){:target="_blank"}.
1. Select **WH Project Offering Request** from the **Project** field and select **Task** from the **Issue Type** field. Click the **Next** button.

1. Once the form has been completed, click the **Create** button. The ticket is submitted, and Jira automatically creates the associated sub-tasks for the work to be completed.

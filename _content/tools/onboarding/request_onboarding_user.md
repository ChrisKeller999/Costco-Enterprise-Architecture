## Before You Begin
The Watson Health Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution is a system which integrates Aha!, Jira, Xray Test Management, Confluence, and GitHub to create an end-to-end solution for WH Offerings to manage requirements, develop and test approved requirements, and enable traceability across key elements of the system.

The Onboarding Request for a user to the Solution initiates a request to grant user access to applicable elements of the Watson Health Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution.

Use the [onboarding request form](https://vbc-jira.watson-health.ibm.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=13687&issuetype=12500){:target="_blank"} to initiate the request.

**Applicable Role(s):** Anyone with access to the WH Jira Solution.

## Procedure

1. Open the [Application Access Request Form](https://vbc-jira.watson-health.ibm.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=13687&issuetype=12500){:target="_blank"} and complete the form for the individual you are requesting access for.
1. The following fields are required for every request:
 - **Summary:** A summary of the access request.
 - **First Name:** The first name of the user who need access.
 - **Last Name:** The last name of the user who need access.
 - **App Access User Email:**  The internet email address of the user needing access (xyz@ibm.com).
 - **Manager’s Name:** The manager’s name, or a manager designee that can approve the request.
 - **Description:** A detailed description of the type of access that is needed. Include any information such as which group(s) and application(s) access is needed for. If you are requesting to have the same access as an existing team member, state that in the description and provide the name of the team member.
 - **Password Reset:** If this is a password reset request, select the system for which the password reset is needed.
 - **Requested Access:** Select all the applications for which access is needed.
 - **Reporter:** The individual raising the request.
 - **HIPAA Security Training:** Acknowledge whether the user requesting access is HIPAA compliant or not.
 - **ITCS300:** Acknowledge whether the user requesting access is ITCS300 compliant or not.

1. Once the form has been completed with as much detailed information as possible, click the **Create** button to submit the request.

## What happens next
A ticket is created in Jira and auto-assigned to the Application Access Team to verify validity. Once the request is determined valid, the ticket will be assigned to the manager that was input into the **Manager’s Name** field for approval or rejection. If the manager approves the request, the ticket is auto-routed back to the queue of the Application Access Team for completion.

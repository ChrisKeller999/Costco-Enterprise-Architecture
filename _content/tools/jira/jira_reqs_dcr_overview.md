# DRAFT

## Before You Begin
Offering Managers create releases and specify Epics (or features) in Aha! for a release based on assessments for value to markets served by Watson Health. After Offering Management approves an Epic in Aha! and pushes the Epic into a Jira, the system automatically creates a clone of the Epic from Aha! in the Offering’s Jira Requirements project as a non-modifiable Epic.

Regardless of whether the Offering is using a 2-Tier model or 3-Tier model for Requirements, the Watson Health (WH) Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution ensures there is an open Design Change Release (DCR) in the WH Jira Requirements project for the specific release of the Offering and that the DCR is associated with the Epic in Aha! that was pushed to the WH ALM Solution.

A DCR defines the scope of a release of an Offering and lives in an Offering’s Jira Requirements project. For each Offering, there is 1 DCR per release and the
DCR specifies the associated features in the release. An Epic in Jira for a specific Offering release is associated with the DCR for that Offering release
for traceability purposes. In other words, the DCR for an Offering release has the trace relationships to an Epic and any Configuration Change Requests (CCRs)
against those Epics.  CCRs are used to manage changes to a requirement, design, development, or test artifacts.

Review the Traceability Metamodel [Traceability Metamodel](../../index#traceability-metamodel) which illustrates the relationship between a DCR and an Epic in Jira.

For information about the WH Jira Requirements project, see [Overview - Working in WH Jira Requirements Projects](../jira_reqs_overview/).

**Applicable Role(s):**

-   DCR Author - Typically someone in a project management role, this individual
    is responsible for all content in the DCR. The DCR Author has edit rights to
    the DCR in Jira and can move the DCR from “New” status through “In Analysis”
    status.

-   DCR Approver - Works with the release DCRs in WH Jira Solution and can
    approve them.

## Procedure

1. The DCR Author navigates to the DCR generated by the system in the
    Requirements project. The DCR is in “New” status.
          ![DCR in New Status](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_new_status.png "DCR in New Status")

    > **Tip:** If you know the DCR number, you can use Jira search. You can also
    >   locate the DCR in the Requirements Project by navigating to the associated
    >   Epic in the Kanban board and viewing the **Released By** information in the
    >   Issue Links section of an Epic in Jira.

1.  The DCR author assigns an owner to the DCR.
          ![Assign owner to DCR](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_assign_owner.png "Assign owner to DCR")

1.  Click **Edit**. In the edit window, at a minimum, the DCR Author ensures an
    owner is assigned and provides a Justification for the DCR. These fields
    must be completed before the DCR can move to “In Analysis” state. Click
    **Update** to save the changes.

1.  Click **Analyze** to move the DCR to “In Analysis’ state.

      ![Click Analyze](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_click_analyze.png "Click Analyze")

      ![DCR in In Analysis status](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_inanalysis_status.png "DCR in In Analysis status")

1. The DCR Author completes required information for the DCR on the Overview,
    Regulatory Assessment, Impact Assessment and Release Documentation tabs
    within the DCR. The Release Documentation tab contains approvals for release
    documents.

    > **Tip:** The DCR Author works with the DCR Approver. When the required
    >   information for the DCR is completed, the DCR Author can optionally assign
    >   the DCR to the DCR Approver so that the system notifies the DCR Approver of the assignment.

1.  To approve the DCR, the DCR Approver navigates to the DCR and clicks
    **Approve** which opens the Approve page. This page consists of Overview,
    Regulatory Assessment, Impact Assessment, and Approvers information. When
    ready to complete the approval, the DCR Approver clicks **Approve**.

      ![Approve Page](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_approve_page.png "Approve Page")

    While DCR approval within the Jira Requirements project is an informal  approval, this approval indicates agreement with the scope of the DCR for   the release and that work on the release can continue.

    The DCR is in "Approved" status.

      ![DCR in Approved Status](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/jira/jira_reqs_dcr_approved_status.png "DCR in Approved Status")


## What to do next

A DCR Author can transition the DCR from “Approved” to “Closed” status when all
the information is populated and the DCR for the release is ready to be closed.

The DCR for the release must be in “Approved” status before WH Requirements
Authors can decompose System Level User Requirements into Detail Level (DL)
Requirements. See [(2-Tier) Decomposing SL User Requirements into DL Requirements](../jira_2tier_decomposing_sl_to_dl/ "2-Tier Requirements") or  [(3-Tier) Decomposing SL User Requirements into DL Requirements](../jira_3tier_decomposing_sl_to_dl/ "3-Tier Requirements").

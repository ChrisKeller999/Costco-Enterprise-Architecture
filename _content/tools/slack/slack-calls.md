Working with the CIO and the CISO teams, we've gotten Slack audio and video conferencing [approved](https://github.ibm.com/Whitewater/Slack/blob/master/security-assessments/videoconference.md){:target="_blank"} for **IBM Confidential** conversations - this is a GREAT solution for Squad-based video conferencing. You can call a single person, or add up to 15 people to a single call.

**Call Basics**

- To call a someone, open a Direct Message and click the phone handset icon at the top of the Slack window.
>**ProTip:** All calls start as audio only, to switch to video, click the camera icon in the call Window
- To add people to an existing call, click the [+] icon in the top right of the call window.
- You can initiate a multi-person call by starting the call from a multi-person direct message.
> **Please note** that Slack limits you to 15 people per call

**Advanced Features**
- The Slack support site has great documentation about using audio/video calling: [Making calls in Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack){:target="_blank"}

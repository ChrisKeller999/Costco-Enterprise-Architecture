### Overview

We've set up an **IBM-wide Shared Channel** on **Slack Enterprise Grid** that **Watson Platform Leaders** can use to provide IBMers with the **latest and greatest** information about **what we've released**.

> **ProTip:** Absolutely, positively, **do not pre-announce anything**. This channel can be seen by **all IBMers** (including our **Sellers**) and is **not approved** for **IBM Confidential** Material.

### Accessing the Channel

The channel can be joined by **any IBMer**, but **only a select few** can **post** anything in the channel.

### Posting Templates

As the channel will be an **official** communications tool for us, we need to maintain **alignment** around annoucements. Please use these patterns...

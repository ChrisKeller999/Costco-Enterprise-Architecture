[**Slack**](https://whitewater.ibm.com/tools/slack?tab=overview){:target="_blank"} is messaging done right. Your conversations follow you no matter what device you use (web / app / tablet / phone). **We live in Slack.**

**Workspaces**
Slack is organized around Workspaces. Workspaces **bring people together** in an open, collaborative environment. IBM has a great many Slack Workspaces, [join a few](../../../support/onboarding#slack).

**Channels**
Organize your conversations in **open channels**. Make a channel for a project, a topic, a Squad, or anything—everyone has a **transparent view** of all that’s going on. For **truly sensitive information**, [create private channels](#private) and invite a few team members. **Slack Enterprise Grid** brings us the ability to create IBM-wide [**shared channels**](#shared). Share what you know, help each other out, break those bottlenecks by **working out in the open**.

**Direct Messages**
Send messages directly to another person or to a small group of people for more **focused conversations**.

**Calls**
Take a conversation from typing to **face-to-face** by starting a **voice or video call** in any Channel or Direct Message. [Make one-on-one or group calls](../../../tools/slack/slack-calls/) right from Slack without needing to open another app or share invite links.

**Apps and Integrations**
Connect all the tools you use to Slack and avoid all that constant switching between apps. [Set up your integration](../../../tools/slack/integrations/) so that you **get all your notifications directly within Slack**—from support requests, code check-ins, and error logs to sales leads—all of them searchable in one central archive.

### Getting access

- See the [onboarding](../../../support/onboarding#slack) page to request access to Slack
- All Slack users **must** read the [Slack@IBM Training Guide](https://ibm.biz/slack-training){:target="_blank"} and the [Slack@IBM FAQ](https://ibm.biz/slack-faq){:target="_blank"}.

### Getting Help

- The CIO's Office has created a number of helpful [Guides for using Slack at IBM](https://whitewater.ibm.com/tools/slack?tab=training){:target="_blank"}
- Hit the #slack-at-ibm channel in your Slack Team


### Apps for Slack...

Amongst high-functioning and highly-collaborative teams, Slack's extendability is essential. There are a number of apps that plug directly in to Slack, providing a great amount of functionality beyond simple messaging directly in to the communication stream of teams. Not every Slack App can be used at IBM. Head to the [Integrations](../../../tools/slack/integrations) page to see what you can and can't use. Slack also provides a very extensive [API](https://api.slack.com/){:target="_blank"} to allow custom integrations to be built. This extendability makes Slack an ideal platform to build [ChatOps](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/what-is-chatops/){:target="_blank"} on top of, which has been show to improve team communication and collaboration.

### Channels

There are _thousands_ of internally-public channels covering a myriad of topics on Slack.
- Click "CHANNELS" in the Slack sidebar to search our list of channels.
- Your Squad members will have some suggestions, ask them...

### Shared Channels
To help different groups to work together efficiently, you can share channels with specific Slack Teams or with all Slack Teams.

> **Tip:** Read about shared channels in the [IBM Whitewater guide](https://whitewater.ibm.com/guides/slack/using-shared-channels){:target="_blank"} before you request one.

#### Request a shared channel

Slack channels are not shared by default. An admin can create a shared channel or convert an existing channel.

* If you work in Watson Health (you use the _ibm-watsonhealth.slack.com_ **IBM Watson Health** Slack team), **open** a [Github issue](https://github.ibm.com/Watson-Health/slack/issues/new?title=Shared%20Channel%20Request&body=Please%20share%20the%20following%20channel%20in%20the%20IBM%20Watson%20Slack%20Team.%0A%0AChannel%20name:%0A%0APlease%20let%20us%20know%20if%20you%20would%20like%20to%20share%20the%20channel%20with%20all%20IBM%20Teams%20or%20just%20specific%20teams...%0A){:target="_blank"} and ask to share a channel.
* Or if you are part of other Slack teams, **ask** how to request a shared channel in your _#general_ channel.

> **Important:** You can't go back. Shared channels can't be “unshared”.

### Private Channels

> **Note:** This section is specifically for the ibm-watson.slack.com team, different Slack teams have different rules, ask in your #general channel...

We work out in the open in Slack (internally-open that is). This is possible due to the fact that entire IBM Watson Slack Team is managed as an **IBM Confidential** Slack Team. You can discuss virtually any topic with other Watson Team members in our channels.

Previously, to comply with IBM Legal and Security controls, only Admins were allowed to create private channels (so that an export of that channel could be guaranteed if requested by Legal/Security).

With Slack's [recent changes to comply with GDPR](https://slack.com/gdpr){:target="_blank"}, Slack can now provide our CIO's Office with the ability to export a channel (even private channels) if we need to comply with a specific Legal/Security request.

As a result, we are switching back to allowing the creation of Private Channels to everyone.

Before you do though, remember that there are still only a _very_ few good reasons to use private channels (temporary acquisition channels, legal clauses in a specific client contract).

We work out in the open so that everyone can be on the same page, please don't forget that.

> **Important:** You can't go back. Private channels can't ever be made public. Think before you switch.


### Private Guest Channels

For those projects working closely with **external** partners, we have the ability to create Private Guest Channels by request. These channels allow you to invite external users that can then join that single channel and communicate with your team. These external guests can only see the contents of that specific channel and members. They cannot see anything else.

To request a Private Guest Channel for the Watson Health Slack Team, [open an issue](http://github.ibm.com/Watson-Health/slack/issues/new?title=Private guest channel request&body=Please create a private guest channel to be used with external partners.%0A%0AChannel name:%0A%0AList of external partner email addresses %28one per line%29:%0A%0A){:target="_blank"}

- A Slack Admin will need to be a member of the channel
- Private channels can **never** be made public once they have been created.

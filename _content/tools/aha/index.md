The **Watson Health** Organization uses Aha! to define our Personas and Strategy, get ideas from our customers, and build our Roadmaps. It integrates with Jira to allow full traceability of key attributes (Hills, Epics, Stories and test cases). You may need to request access differently based on your role in the Organization.

## Before You Begin
Aha! is the home for everything related to business strategy, user personas, and product roadmaps. The Watson Health Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution integrates Aha! with Jira to enable full traceability for an Offering’s lifecycle across key elements including requirements, development stories, and test cases.

Hills are created in Aha! A Hill is the big goal. It contains a who, what, and wow factor. Hills turn users’ needs into project goals, helping the team align around a common understanding. Hills aren’t detailed requirements - they’re statements of intended outcome. Hills address who the outcome will serve, what they will be enabled to do, and the differentiator that will make this outcome worth the users’ time. Hills are eventually decomposed in Aha! into smaller units called Epics.

Hills are used to express value to customers along with a measurable outcome. Hills should be defined or refined into work that can reasonably be achieved in a quarter of a year. Hills contain an articulate description of the value and contain information pertaining to the business value.

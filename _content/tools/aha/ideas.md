**Ideas** in Aha! are similar to **requests for enhancement**. Externally available **Portals** allow us to collaborate with our stakeholders and **prioritize** their feedback. Ideas can be **upvoted** by registered users. **Accepted** Ideas are then taken forward and linked to **Epics, Hills, and Strategic Priorities**.

This allows us to track and Idea from **thought to production** in a closed loop fashion.

> **ProTip:** Before submitting an Idea, [<img src="https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/aha/thinkwritesubmit-blogpost.png" width="300px" align="right">](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/think-write-submit/)read the blog post by Tim Brantner called [Think, Write, Submit: New Ideas Portal for IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/think-write-submit/). This incredibly useful article will help you get the most out of Ideas. There's also an [**Aha! Ideas Portals Presentation**](https://ibm.box.com/s/0umrd4mygcznc2nap12zed1h8xjv7d2t) you should watch.

## Working with Ideas...

The Idea is reviewed by the team to determine if the request is “actionable”.
If it is Accepted, the Idea is:
- Marked Accepted by a Status Change
- Prioritized against existing backlogs
- Linked to Hills or Epics already created or in plan. Or promoted to Hill or Epic by the team

If an Idea is Rejected, the status is changed to Will Not Implement. This may be if it is determined to be:
- Not aligned with our Strategy
- Too costly to implement based on revenue opportunity

The person that submits the Ideas is stored as the **“Creator”**

The Creator receives an email when:| The Owner is responsible to*:
-----------------------------------|----------------------------
The Idea is created | Add a public comment requesting or providing information
The Idea is updated with a public comment | Link the Idea to an Hill or Epic where appropriate
The Idea transitions states | Transition the state of the Idea

*_Note: The Owner should comment on the Idea whether it is Accepted or Not, to allow an end-to-end communication with the submitter and the subscribers to the Idea._

To begin reviewing your Ideas:

1. Create an Ideas List Report that shows the data your team is interested in (for example):
- Idea Name
- Idea Status
- Assigned To
- Created By
- Record Links
- Date Created
- Idea Priority

2. Filter the Ideas List so that it contains Ideas specific to your team (for example):
- Select Product Names
- Owning Segment/Owning Team
- Idea Priority
- Idea Status

3. If you would like to see your Ideas Status as a Pie Chart for your team, similar to how they are presented in the Overview (for example):
- Reports --> Charts
- +New Report --> Start with Example Chart - "Pie chart: Structured Ideas Status"
- Select Product Names
- Filter Structured Ideas by Owning Teams

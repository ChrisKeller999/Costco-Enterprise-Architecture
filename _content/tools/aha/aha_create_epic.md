## Before You Begin
Aha! is the home for everything related to business strategy, user personas, and product roadmaps. The Watson Health Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Solution integrates Aha! with Jira to enable full traceability for an Offering’s lifecycle across key elements including requirements, development stories, and test cases.

Aha! Hills are decomposed into smaller units called Epics. An Epic in Aha! is a collection of customer value centered on a common theme. Epics follow a similar pattern to Hills, but replace “wow” with “why” to establish a who, what, and why pattern. If the Hill is the big goal, then the Epics are the capabilities, behaviors, or user experiences that enable us to reach the goal.

Epics represent the further decomposition of Hills. Hills also express value and measurable outcome but are scoped to a feature level in the context of a broader experience.

**Applicable Role(s):**  Offering Manager or any person with an Aha! Contributor role

## Procedure

1. From the **Epic/features** tab of your Offering, click the **Add epic/feature** button.

# Watson Health Tools
The following tool set consists of tools that are specifically customized and hosted for Watson Health, giving teams an integrated set of best-in-class tools to take projects from idea to production.
- [Aha!](../aha/) - Team based offering management tool for project status and high-level requirements grooming.
- [GitHub](../github/) - IBM's internal deployment of GitHub Enterprise
- [Jira](../jira/) - Web-based Agile project management tool used to plan and track development efforts, assign tasks, and decide story points.
- [Confluence](../confluence/) - Collaborative document management integrated with Jira. Provides document control and version management of documents.
- [Xray](../xray/) - Xray Test Management tool for Jira that supports test planning, test design, test execution and test reporting.

The following are additional tools which are used by Watson Health extensively.
- [Slack](../slack/) - Team-based collaborative communication
- [Cognitive Architect](../ca/) - Team-based online architectural modeling tool using the IBM Team Solution Design Method templates.

## Tool Integration plan

While the tools listed below are the intended tooling for Watson Health, there currently is an effort underway to integrate all of the tools together into a cohesive whole that will allow:
- Traceability between all artifacts from high-level requirements down to builds against stories.
- Common template with a seamless workflow across Aha!, Jira, Confluence and GitHub.
- Integration between the Watson Health Playbook tasks and the tasks in the tooling workflows.
- Common tool licensing for Watson Health so that all teams can get up to speed quickly without too much bureaucracy.
- Support ISO 9001 and the WH QMS needs in the same flow as Non-GxP projects. This means that a common set of templates and consistent set of documentation will be created for all projects, but the process will support taking Validation and Verification to the next level when needed.

<a id="traceability-metamodel"></a>
At a high level the Traceability Metamodel is as follows:

![Traceability Metamodel](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/metamodel.png)

This translates to a metamodel tooling implementation that looks like the following:

![Implementation of Traceability Metamodel](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/aha-jira-github-overview.jpg)

The integration landscape that is under construction can be seen in the following diagram:

![Tool Integration Plan](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/tools/WHPlaybookToolTopology.jpg)

_**Please understand that the tool integration is not completed, but when it is, training will be made available. At such a time everyone will be expected to use this process. Therefore getting to know it now while it is still under construction is recommended.**_

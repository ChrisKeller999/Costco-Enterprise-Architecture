Box enables you to securely store and access content in the cloud. It also allows you to share files and collaborate with other IBMers from anywhere on any registered device.

Unlimited storage.

**_Unlimited storage!_**

Box.com is not only approved for IBM Confidential material, but some kinds of client and sensitive data as well. See [Box@IBM Help](https://w3.ibm.com/help/#/article/40138){:target="_blank"} for details.

> **ProTip:** Sharing Files with all IBMers

By default, Box.com sets the default permissions to people you invite to share (one by one, using their email address). For _much_ of the content we all work with, you can set the access rights to "People in your company". This will open access up to all IBMers. Obviously, you should use this option appropriately, use your judgement.

## Troubleshooting

> **ProTip:** Documents and folders have owners, make sure your team takes care of that before people leave, here's a [link with details](https://community.box.com/t5/Collaboration-and-Sharing/How-Do-I-Change-The-Owner-Of-A-Folder/ta-p/149){:target="_blank"}.



**Q:** A former IBMer left the company already and I need access to data they previously owned.

**A:** If you need access to data from an inactive Box@IBM account, a Box@IBM Admin can transfer all or some of the data stored in the inactive account to another Box@IBM account.

  In order for this request to be processed, the IBM@Box Admin will need the following information emailed to ibmbox@us.ibm.com with a subject line "Transfer Ownership"

- The w3id of the inactive account (ex. ibmbox@us.ibm.com)
- The specific folder or data which needs to be transferred
- A functional manager's approval of this transfer. To speed up the process, please have the functional manager's approval before sending the initial email to Box@IBM.

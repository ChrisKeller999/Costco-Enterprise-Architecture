## Overview

Cognitive Architect is the online, IBM Built, replacement for Rational System Architect as a primary tool to build method driven architectures in a team driven manner.

## Why Cognitive Architect

- Team Driven: Cognitive Architect allows multiple editors on an architecture. This has always been an issue with other Architecture tools, including Rational System Architect.
- Artifacts based on [Team Solution Design](http://method.ibm.com/rmchtml_teamsd/index.htm#core.default.nav_view.extend-ibm_lic/guidances/supportingmaterials/welcome_umf_B16D0AC2.html){:target="_blank"}, an IBM approved architectural method.
- Simple to use! While it doesn't have all the capabilities of larger tool suites, it is under constant development and it is a strategic IBM tool that will continue to improve.

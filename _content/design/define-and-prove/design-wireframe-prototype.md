## What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a low fidelity representation of a design. It should clearly show:

- The main groups of content (what?)
- The structure of information (where?)
- A description and basic visualization of the user – interface interaction (how?)

Wireframes are not just meaningless sets of grey boxes, though they may look exactly like that. Consider them as the backbone of your visual design and remember that wireframes should contain a representation of every important piece of the final product.

Wireframes also play a critical role when explaining Use Cases which require human interaction. You can even refer to a specific element in a wireframe from a Use Case. This is a great way to give greater detail where needed. Use Cases can therefore provide a scenario for to use the wireframe.

Wireframes should be created quickly and almost the whole time should be spent communicating with team members and thinking. The mere activity of wireframe-creation should be really quick.

If something takes too much time to prepare (e.g. choice of icons, uploading images), you have to represent it in a simplified way (e.g. using placeholders – crossed rectangles for images, plus an appropriate description). We tend to call wireframes low-fidelity deliverables (lo-fi).

Remember – a well-created wireframe communicates design in a crystal clear way and sets a path for the whole team.

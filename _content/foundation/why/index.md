**Why do we need to define how we work?**

Empowered and highly collaborative cross functional teams with diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are essential to achieving the Watson Health mission – addressing the most wickedly complex and pressing health challenges through innovative uses of data and cognitive insights.

This playbook is intended to clarify **who** needs to do **what** (i.e., key “jobs to be done”), and **when** they need to do them, and to offer useful **principles, best practices, and tools** to help each person and team know **how** to work together and get their jobs done throughout the offering life

**Our Principles and Practices**
--------------------------------

We apply a human-centered, business focused, and agile approach throughout the offering lifecycle that integrates and blends a number of IBM practice frameworks and principles:

**Offering Management Wheel** – A phased adaptive approach outlining how we validate, define, build, launch, and managing our offerings throughout the lifecycle.

**IBM Design Thinking** – An iterative human-centered approach and problem solving framework that enables and focuses our teams on delivering valuable outcomes and delightful experiences for the people they serve

**Agile**– A lean iterative approach to development that enables small empowered cross functional squads to rapidly deliver value and adapt to change

>   _( Note that due to the regulatory environment in the health domain, for selected offerings we sometimes have to apply the practices and procedures of a Quality Management System (QMS) – A set of practices required to demonstrate and ensure that our offerings are safe, effective, high quality and meet health related requlatory requirements. To learn more, see the Quality Management System section of the WH Playbook.)_

[Offering Management
Wheel:](http://calmedia.atlanta.ibm.com/om_academy/process_artifacts.php){:target="_blank"} IBM’s Offering Management Wheel outlines a phased adaptive approach to validating, defining, building, launching and managing our offerings from initial idea/opportunity hypothesis (Market Opportunity & Approach through design, definition, and further validation (Define & Prove), to building and launch (Build & Deliver) to continuous adoption & impact evaluation & improvement (Sense & Respond) [Learn more at the Offering Management Academy](http://calmedia.atlanta.ibm.com/om_academy/index.php){:target="_blank"} .

[Enterprise Design
Thinking:](http://gbslearn-stg.atlanta.ibm.com/iSPO/design_thinking_university/index.html){:target="_blank"} IBM’s Enterprise Design Thinking is a human centered design approach and framework for solving problems for people at speed and scale. It has three major parts:

- **The Principles:** A relentless **focus on human/user outcomes**, **restless reinvention** (treating everything is a prototype), and **empowerment of diverse teams** guides the way we work

- **The Loop:** Iteratively working through loops of **observing**, **reflecting** and **making** enables our teams to rapidly innovate, learn, and deliver value for humans and organizations

- **The Keys:** A set of specific techniques and practices to align and scale our cross functional teams to deliver great human outcomes and value – e.g., **Hills** to align teams around delivering specific human outcomes and experiences, **Sponsor Users** to engage and learn from and test/validate/optimize what we make , and **Playbacks** to share feedback and learn together along the way.

[Agile:](../../../dev/agile/ibm-squad-thinking) Agile is an **iterative**, adaptive, and pragmatic development process that **empowers small
self-organizing cross functional teams** to solve problems and deliver value efficiently and while accelerating learning and nimble adaptation. Agile relies
on **incremental, iterative work** sequences that are commonly known as **sprints** to focus teams and enable them to respond quickly to the
unpredictability of constructing software. [Learn more about the basics at [Agile\@IBM](https://agile-ibm.mybluemix.net/){:target="_blank"} ]

We strive to integrate these three practice frameworks into a coherent unified approach. The objectives and jobs to be done vary depending upon where an
offering is in the life cycle - which often requires shifting the precise composition (e.g., skill sets) and size of the cross functional team.

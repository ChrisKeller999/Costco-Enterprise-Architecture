**Who does what and when?**

We all want a simple, clear and standardized way of working together across our business. This section outlines key activities and outcomes across the offering lifecycle and describes ways of working across disciplines.

Key Terms
---------

[Hills:](http://gbslearn-stg.atlanta.ibm.com/iSPO/design_thinking_university/hills.html){:target="_blank"} Hills describe specific **human-centered business objectives** for an offering used to **focus and align cross functional teams**. They are formed from the ‘to be scenario’ defined by the team and are a statement of intent, written as a meaningful human/user outcome. A Hill identifies the human/user who will experience the value (Who), describes a human outcome that the offering aims to deliver (What), and the delightful and transformative experience associated with the outcome (Wow). Note that Hills should not describe the how—the specifics of how the Hills will be achieved/the specific shape/form of the solution is left to the human centered, agile, cross functional team to figure out. (In this context, Technical Foundation describes the cross cutting or foundational development investment and work required to support the Hills.

[Epics:](../../../dev/planning-and-tracking-work/ongoing-delivery/#epics)Hills are broken down into Epics. An Epic can be defined as a group of work/tasks that have a common objective – in our model the objective is to support the achievement of the human goals, scenarios, or jobs to be done explicitly outlined or implied within Hills and/or the foundational technical work required to support one or more hills. (If we can’t connect the dots between our Epics and our Hills, then we need to reflect on what we are doing and why) Epics form the highest level in our product backlog and are prioritized and actioned by the agile squad. It may take several sprints to complete an Epic and they are typically broken down into a number of smaller User Stories.

[User
Stories:](../../../dev/planning-and-tracking-work/ongoing-delivery/#stories) A User Story is a short description of a desired functionality requirement features. User stories are written from the perspective of an end user.

**Portfolio Management**
------------------------

In the world of health there are a wide range of complex, interdependent, and intersecting challenges and opportunities that Watson health could attempt to address. Indeed, through acquisition and organic growth, we already have a wide, diverse, complex, and often overlapping or intersecting portfolio of Watson Health offerings In this context, we realized that we needed a systematic way to strategically align, govern and prioritize our offering investments and optimize our portfolio to ensure that we invest in the highest value opportunities (where we can make the greatest human and market impact), avoid duplication of effort, fragmentation of our portfolio and brand/value proposition, and optimize alignment/complementarity/synergy between our offerings.

In this context, the Watson Health Portfolio Management process outlines the path and standards for how we generate, evaluate, and validate new, early stage offering ideas from a business, tech, and human perspectives, and how we prioritize portfolio investments. The Portfolio Management process can be viewed as a precursor to and/or a very early component of the Market Opportunity & Approach phase in which the WH Innovation Board works with business and
disciplinary leaders to generate, evaluate and prioritize early stage offering ideas and hypotheses from various vantage points ( including fit with and enrichment of the WH portfolio, problems that matter from a human and market perspective and for which AI is both relevant and potential feasible, etc.) before investing the resources and time to more fully flesh out and validate the opportunity and the proposed solution/Offering.

Selected hypotheses or opportunities that are judged by the Watson Health Innovation Board to warrant further investigation and limited investment are moved forward. This may involve execution of a very focused time boxed “vision sprint” or a more formal shift to the Market Opportunity & Approach phase.

**Market Opportunity & Approach**
---------------------------------

The goal of Market Opportunity & Approach is to leanly and rapidly understand the human/organizational problems that matter most within a particular domain or market segment and to formulate and evaluate the viability of potential value propositions and high level solution concepts from human, business, and technical perspectives – before deploying a larger team to more fully flesh out the details of a specific offering (in Define & Prove).

In short, this phase can be viewed as fleshing out and testing the various components and hypotheses within a Lean Business Canvas – to identify the right problem for Watson Health to solve, and then outline and assess whether a potential value proposition and solution concept is viable and valuable from a market, human, and technology perspective.

During Market Opportunity and Approach a lean cross functional squad executes a “vision sprint” (4-8 weeks in duration) involving rapid observational/field research with target users, formulation of value propositions and sketching of solution concepts, technical feasibility & architectural analysis, and rapid iterative testing of value props and high level solution concepts with representative potential buyers and target users (“sponsor users”).

The culmination of the Market Opportunity & Approach phase is a decision after “Playback 0” about whether to further invest and proceed onward to Define & Prove work – to achieve a fuller definition and validation of the offering business model, value proposition, experience design and technical design as potential readiness to Build & Deliver the offering.

### The Team

The Market Opportunity & Approach product team is a lean cross-functional squad made up of the following team members:

| **Squad**              | **Stakeholders**     | **Executives**  |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Offering Manager       | Development Manager  | Director        |
| Design Researcher/Lead | Architect            | Vice President  |
| Development Lead       | Design Practice Lead | General Manager |
| SMEs                   | SMEs                 |                 |
| Sales and Marketing    | Data Scientist       |                 |
| Finance                |                      |                 |

**Who does What and When?**

During Market Opportunity & Approach, the team works to develop IBM’s market POV (including the needs of organizations and people within a segment), to decide if further investment in a solution concept is warranted. (See [Offering Management Academy](http://calmedia.atlanta.ibm.com/om_academy/index.php){:target="_blank"} for more details)

In this phase, a lean team rapidly investigates a domain and/or a hypothesized offering opportunity in order to clarify and validate the right human problem to solve and the market opportunity, and to illustrate the outlines of a potential solution concept in an experimental and agile environment.  The lean Cross-Functional Squad is made of OM, Design, Development, Clinical SMEs, and Data Scientist (Optional).

![MOA Activities](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/moa-activities.png)

The key deliverables for Market Opportunity & Approach include:

Market POV and Business Model Canvas Explore

User Personas and Scenarios

Solution “Concept Car” (i.e, high level offering concept definition and illustration of the user experience)

At Market Playback, the senior leadership team decides whether the opportunity warrants further definition and investment of resources, time, and effort (see Define and Prove), They can also decide NOT to invest, or to pivot and explore further. The Review Board decides if WH’s unique POV on market potential justifies committing additional time and resources to more fully design the offering and develop the business plan. As outlined on the Portfolio Management section, the Evaluation Criteria are:

**Business & Market Impact:** Value to Buyer, Market Size & Growth, Competitive Differentiation

**Human Impact:** Value to End-User, Adoption Barriers, Early Adopters & Sponsor Users

**Strategy & Synergies:** Strategic Target Areas, Relation to WH Capabilities & Assets

**Feasibility:** Technical Capabilities, Compliance/Regulatory

**Scale NPV & ROI:** Time to Revenue, Investment & Cost Structure

**Define and Prove**
--------------------

The goal of Define and Prove is to decide whether a proposed offering will **differentially address** a market opportunity based on Sponsor User
validation. (See [Offering Management Academy](http://calmedia.atlanta.ibm.com/om_academy/index.php){:target="_blank"}).

In other words, the team works to further define, refine, test, and validate an offering from business, human/user experience, and technical perspectives before fully investing in developing and delivering it to the market. In short, the aim is to “nail it before you scale it”.

By the end of the Define and Prove phase the team will have defined the initial scope of the offering in the form of validated Hills, defined and validated the user experience architecture, key interaction flows, and the overall user interface layout, look, and feel of the offering, defined and validated the technical architecture, and outlined an experience-based release roadmap.

### The Team

During Define and Prove, the product team is made up of the following team members:

| **Squad**                                              | **Stakeholders**     | **Executives**  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Product Owner                                          | Development Manager  | Director        |
| Business Analyst                                       | Offering Manager     | Vice President  |
| Design Team - Lead/UX/UI/Research/FED/Content Designer | Architect            | General Manager |
|                                                        | Design Practice Lead |                 |

Within the Squad, the Product Owner, Business Analyst and Design Team meet on a daily basis to review work in progress.

While the Stakeholders are brought into these daily meetings when necessary, typically the stakeholders meet with the squad weekly to review current designs, understand user feedback and discuss feasibility, etc.

The Executives attend informal and formal playbacks, e.g. Hills Playback and Playback 0.

**Who does What and When?**

Getting to Hills Playback
-------------------------

Hills are essential in order to align a cross functional offering team on a shared mission to deliver specific outcomes (WHO) and compelling experiences
(WOW) to defined target humans/users (WHO). Hills (along with an Experience-Based Roadmap) enable the team to focus on prioritized human needs and iteratively deliver valuable human/business outcomes and experiences as they work through human centered agile cycles of observation, reflection, and making.

In order to define the Hills and hold a successful Hills playback, each discipline has an important role to play: Offering Management is accountable for the definition of the offering value proposition, strategy, and vision as well as the validated, viable, and prioritized Hills. Design is responsible for informing and validating the value proposition, defining the user experience architecture, understanding and modeling the goals, scenarios, work practices, and needs, mental models, and workflows of key target users/potential early adopters, and collaborating on the experience-based roadmap and Hills through iterative design and design research. Development is responsible for assessing technical feasibility of the offering concepts/vision and Hills and defining the requisite technical foundation and technical architecture.

At this phase of the offering lifecycle, the team’s Offering Manager and Design Researcher has already produced key artifacts such as the lean business model canvas, market definition, competitive analysis (market and user experience), and user/buyer personas, and has engaged iteratively with Sponsor Users. At the Hills Workshop a synthesis of the information, perspectives, and insights is presented to the team, enabling team alignment on vision and strategy, the end users, and the human-business problems to be solved – resulting in the definition and prioritization of Hills for the team to tackle.

![Hill Definition](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/hill-definition.png)

Hills Playback is a full team meeting of core, stakeholder and executives, it serves to inform and align the execute stakeholders on the offering’s Hills. At this stage executives can decide to proceed to Playback 0, cancel, or pivot.

Getting to Playback 0
---------------------

To get to playback 0 the team focuses on iteratively defining, validating and refining the solution in line with the project Hills - essentially fleshing out the “how” we will deliver the “what” and the “wow” to the target people/users (the “who”). Each discipline works together to refine, test, and validate the details of the proposed offering in terms of business viability (business) feasibility (engineering) and human/user experience value/effectiveness (design) through iterative cycles of observing, reflecting, and making informed by engagement/assessment with representative target users (Sponsor Users, etc.).

In short, by Playback 0, the team should have defined and validated (through continued human engagement/assessments), the business model, the user experience architecture, key user interactions and user interfaces, technical architecture/design, an experience-based roadmap and defined the backlog (Epics) for the initial release as potential input into Build & Deliver.

![DAP Activities](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/dap-activities.png)

Playback 0 is a full team meeting of core, stakeholder and executives, it serves to inform and align the executive stakeholders on the offering’s solution and release plan. At this stage executives can decide to proceed to Build and Deliver, cancel, or pivot.


**Build and Deliver**
---------------------

During Build and Deliver the team work together to iteratively build and deliver working software that aligns with the prioritized Hills, human/user needs and the release plan. (Note that Define & Prove may have produced user experience and technical prototypes/proofs of concept but would not functional releasable software).

### The Team

During Build and Deliver, the size of the team will typically and multiple squads may actually be formed. The meeting/collaboration cadence between the core squad(s), stakeholders and executives meet also evolves:

| **Squad**                                              | **Stakeholders**     | **Executives**  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Product Owner                                          | Development Manager  | Director        |
| Squad Leader                                           | Offering Manager     | Vice President  |
| Business Analyst                                       | Architect            | General Manager |
| Design Team - Lead/UX/UI/Research/FED/Content Designer | Design Practice Lead |                 |
| Engineer(s)                                            |                      |                 |
| Tester(s)                                              |                      |                 |

The Squad(s) meets at daily stand-ups, sprint planning and sprint retrospective sessions. The Stakeholders meet with the squad at end of sprint demos. The Executives attend informal and/or formal delivery playbacks.

**Who does What and When?**

Typically, the Design and Business members of the squad are at least one sprint ahead of Engineering.

![Sprints](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/sprints.png)

![Sprint Timeline](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/sprint-timeline.png)

**Sense and Respond**

During Sense and Respond the team works together to measure, assess, and gain insight into the market/user adoption and business-human impact of the offering (represented in the Offering scorecard, OBDR, NPS, SaaS dashboard, Adoption & Impact Measurement Analyses, etc.) to identify and understand barriers to market/user adoption and user success, and opportunities for offering optimization, enrichment, and innovation Insights gained during Sense & Respond are used to make decisions about adjustments to offering definition and/or GTM & Delivery approach (including sunsetting an offering). (See [Offering Management Academy](http://calmedia.atlanta.ibm.com/om_academy/index.php){:target="_blank"} for more details)

More specifically, insights are used to inform continuous improvement of the offering, inform and prioritize the backlog and roadmap, trigger and shape targeted adoption acceleration/GTM activities, and to surface and prioritize new potential areas for offering innovation (e.g., offering pivots, companion offerings, novel extensions of the offering etc.).

Offering pivots, novel hypotheses/opportunities and potential offering extensions may trigger Market Opportunity & Approach like investigations before the Offering team invests significant resources in these opportunities.

### The Team

During Build and Deliver, the size of the squad may decrease:

| **Squad**              | **Stakeholders**     | **Executives**  |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Product Owner          | Development Manager  | Director        |
| Design Lead/Researcher | Offering Manager     | Vice President  |
| Architect              | Architect            | General Manager |
|                        | Design Practice Lead |                 |
|                        | Sales & Marketing    |                 |
|                        |                      |                 |

**Who does What and When?**

During the Sense & Respond phase the Offering Manager engages with the Sales & Marketing team, customers and prospects, and the Design Researcher/Adoption Analyst to analyze and understand the customer adoption journey (including the digital try and buy experience) and end-user adoption experience/usage patterns. This includes but it not limited to analyzing qualitative and quantitative
customer feedback (e.g., NPS and other surveys, customer user groups, etc.)

![SAR Activities](https://pages.github.ibm.com/watson-health-playbook/resources/images/foundation/sar-activities.png)

In addition, the Adoption Analyst/Design Researcher executes Adoption & Impact Measurement (AIM) activities in collaboration with the Design Lead and the Offering Manager -- analyzing offering usage patterns and key user adoption/success metrics, conducting targeted user assessments/testing and field
research to evaluate adoption progress and offering impact and illuminate barriers/issues/opportunities impacting on full user adoption and scenario success.

Insights from AIM may be used by the Offering Manager, Sales & Marketing, the Design Lead, and the Content Designer inform the creation of targeted Adoption Acceleration Plans and materials, serve as input into the backlog (new user stories, prioritization of user stories, etc.). for the delivery squad to work on in upcoming sprints/releases. Iterative user assessments/Sponsor User engagement are integrated into all sprints to inform and guide the execution/optimization of offering improvements.

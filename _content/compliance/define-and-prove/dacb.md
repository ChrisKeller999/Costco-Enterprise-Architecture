The DACB reviews requests for access to patient-level data from datasets ONLY for within its scope, such as Explorys, MarketScan, CED/LCED and Micromedex (Combined EMR Dataset and Limited Combined EMR Dataset). Team reviews allowable uses per regulations and other agreements; whether it is allowable use under IBM policies; doesnâ€™t violate any policies or laws to bio-ethics, geography and what happens to data after an engagement (data destruction)

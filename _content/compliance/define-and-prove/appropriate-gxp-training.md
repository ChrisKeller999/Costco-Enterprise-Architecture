## Appropriate GxP Training Required
To be able to work in WH you need to be trained on our WH Quality Management System (QMS), Good x Practices (GxP) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## How do I get started?
You will need to be registered in [LDS](https://lsgrcoe-csfe-1.ibmcloud.com/){:target="_blank"} which is usually done at the project level. All development roles will need to be registered.

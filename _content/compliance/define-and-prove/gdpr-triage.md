Furthermore, if team decides they are not enabling at this time; team must capture within privacy deviation process which can be accessed in [QDMS](https://lsgrcoe-csfe-1.ibmcloud.com/OTCS/cs.exe?func=ll&objaction=overview&objid=21933324){:target="_blank"}, If you do not have access to QDMS, your mutli-functional team can provide you with the most recent SOP and FRM.

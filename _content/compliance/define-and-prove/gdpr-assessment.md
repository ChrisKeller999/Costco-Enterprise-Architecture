## What needs to be done?
Complete GDPR assessment if required by the outcome of the [GDPR Triage](../gdpr-triage) step.

## How do I get started?
After identifying in GDPR Triage the type of assessment required & the process, Multifunctional team will assist the OM teams to complete one of the following

1. GPA (Global Privacy Assessment):  Data Controllers - IBM determines the purpose and controls how the data is processed, stored and/or used.  [Example can be found in GPA Wiki](https://w3.ibm.com/ibm/privacy/assessment.html?r3){:target="_blank"} or [GPATool](https://ibm-assess.truste.com/#/project/new/about?templateId=a7dc056c-be42-48f8-af7e-a56b05c1022e&owner=currentUser&final=1){:target="_blank"}
    - Offering / application level and has no other applicable PI but stores In Scope BCI (Business Contract Information) within; application tool where BCI is stored or collected only requires GPA
    - Mobile applications
    - Internal applications
2. Processor Playbook:  Data Processors - WH processes personal data on behalf of the Data Controller.  Enables or assists Controller in complying with their GDPR obligations Examples: See [Processor Playbook](https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/353009876551){:target="_blank"}
    - Offerings like WCM or WFO where we process personal data on behalf of our client
    - [Risk Assessment training](https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/309444735452){:target="_blank"}
3. On Premises Assessment:  provide a “shrink-wrapped” software to clients.  The client is the processor and/or controller and is responsible for their data.  IBM is not the processor/controller.  Examples: [On-premise worksheet](https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/365244025455){:target="_blank"}
    - Social Program Manager On Premises
    - iConnect Suite
4. Deviation process  - Follow instructions in [WH_SUPP_SOP_0047](https://lsgrcoe-csfe-1.ibmcloud.com/OTCS/cs.exe?func=ll&objaction=overview&objid=21933324){:target="_blank"}. If you do not have access to QDMS, your mutli-functional team can provide you with the most recent SOP and [form](https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/389198578289){:target="_blank"}.

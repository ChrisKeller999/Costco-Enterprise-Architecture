## What needs to be done here?
[Leverage the ICTQ](../../../dev/market-opportunity/ictq/) and the Asset Inventory process to determine the reviews to be generated for the data content obligations (royalties, usage rights, etc.) and help facilitate if need to purchase new knowledge sets (ie not client data).
The team will analyze sources of data being used / proposed to use for each offering and provide the obligations to which the offering must adhere to compliantly use the licensed data or content.
You will coordinate with the Data Governance team to understand and build in any required controls or information into the IGC (Information Governance Catalog)

## How do I get started?
Offering Manager with Data Content Teams. Currently there are two teams at Watson Health who help review royalties / usage rights and assist in procuring data (non-client related); Jackie B. team (Lisa Miller/Schaumburg/IBM) for Truven & Explorys and Kaveh M. team for all other WH Offerings.

### Step by step
1. After identifying any non-client related data sets connect with Jackie (T/E) or Kaveh (all other WH) to learn usage rights, royalties, etc that offering must comply to
2. If want to purchase new knowledge data â€“ pursue thru Jackie / Kaveh team they will assist with coordination with procurement, legal, finance
3. Ensure offering team understands and is abiding by these usage rights as develop offering.

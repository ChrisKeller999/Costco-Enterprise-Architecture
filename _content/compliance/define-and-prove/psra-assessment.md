## What needs to be done?
The PSRA is a risk assessment that addresses privacy and security risks, regulations, and standards and is undertaken as part of a compliance and risk management strategy. This permits a timely identification of potential privacy and security risks and the opportunity to avoid or mitigate the risks.  The PSRA outlines specific mitigation actions, identifies designated owners, highlights mitigation completion deadlines, and includes an appropriate notation of risks that cannot be mitigated or require ongoing action. The PSRA process requires appropriate Business Owner approval of all residual risks and risk mitigation steps.

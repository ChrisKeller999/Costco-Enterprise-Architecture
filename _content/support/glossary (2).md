##### A running wiki of Watson teams' lexicon and lingo

___

## Cognitive Computing
 A category of technologies that uses natural language processing and machine learning to enable people and machines to interact more naturally to extend and magnify human expertise and cognition.
Corpus: A collection of source documents that have been ingested by the system, but not yet trained for a specific domain or target solution.

___

## Hypotheses
 The process of producing possible answers to a given question. When asked a question, Watson relies on hypothesis generation and evaluation to rapidly parse relevant evidence and evaluate responses from disparate data.

___

## Ingestion
 The process of feeding data into the system to create its base of knowledge. Processing is performed on the content as it is added to the system, including the creation of derived data resources such as search indexes and a formal knowledge base, and natural language preprocessing of text corpora.

___

## Machine Learning Model
 The application of past experience, such as training data, to determine or predict the correct outcome of future experiences based on characteristics of the data. These past experiences are captured in the form of a model by calculating feature scores for each candidate answer or evidence and combining that with known outcomes.

___

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 A field of artificial intelligence and linguistics that studies the problems inherent in the processing and manipulation of natural language, with an aim to increase the ability of computers to understand human languages.

___

## Tooling
 The administration, configuration, and set up interface for a product

___

## Training Data
 A set of question and answer pairs that are used to teach the machine learning models in the system. These questions and answers are representative of the types of questions that users might ask and answers expected in the use case.

___

## Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
 An Apache architecture that defines a framework for implementing systems, such as Watson systems, for the analysis of unstructured data.

___

## Unstructured Data
 Any data that is stored in an unstructured format rather than in fixed fields. Data in a word processing document is an example of unstructured data.

___

## Watson
 A cognitive computing system that specializes in understanding the meaning of questions posed in natural human language and that draws on a broad domain of knowledge to respond quickly.

___

## Watson Company Analyzer
 Helps users reduce the time and effort to collect, digest and synthesize information for building strategic business relationships through comprehensive company profiles—enabling them to better understand customers and accelerate opportunities.

___

## Watson Engagement Advisor
 Interacts with customers, listens to questions and offers solutions, learning with every human interaction and growing its collection of knowledge—quickly adapting to the way people think.

___

## Watson Explorer
 Accesses and analyzes structured and unstructured content—presenting data, analytics and cognitive insights in a single view, giving users the information they’re looking for while uncovering trends, patterns and relationships.

___

## Watson Health
 From advancing personal training to cancer treatment, from clinical trial matching to insulin pumps that think, Watson Health is transforming the way organizations deliver health and wellness.

___

## Watson Knowledge Studio
 Enables subject matter experts and developers to teach Watson the linguistic nuances of industries and knowledge domains—without writing a single line of code.

___
## Bot
a bot is an application that performs an automated task, such as setting an alarm, telling you the weather or searching online.
___

## Cognitive Computing
 A category of technologies that uses natural language processing and machine learning to enable people and machines to interact more naturally to extend and magnify human expertise and cognition.
Corpus: A collection of source documents that have been ingested by the system, but not yet trained for a specific domain or target solution.

___

## Hypotheses
 The process of producing possible answers to a given question. When asked a question, Watson relies on hypothesis generation and evaluation to rapidly parse relevant evidence and evaluate responses from disparate data.


## Ingestion
 The process of feeding data into the system to create its base of knowledge. Processing is performed on the content as it is added to the system, including the creation of derived data resources such as search indexes and a formal knowledge base, and natural language preprocessing of text corpora.
___

## Machine Learning Model
 The application of past experience, such as training data, to determine or predict the correct outcome of future experiences based on characteristics of the data. These past experiences are captured in the form of a model by calculating feature scores for each candidate answer or evidence and combining that with known outcomes.
___

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 A field of artificial intelligence and linguistics that studies the problems inherent in the processing and manipulation of natural language, with an aim to increase the ability of computers to understand human languages.
___

## Tooling
 The administration, configuration, and set up interface for a product
___

## Training Data
 A set of question and answer pairs that are used to teach the machine learning models in the system. These questions and answers are representative of the types of questions that users might ask and answers expected in the use case.
___

## Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
 An Apache architecture that defines a framework for implementing systems, such as Watson systems, for the analysis of unstructured data.
___

## Unstructured Data
 Any data that is stored in an unstructured format rather than in fixed fields. Data in a word processing document is an example of unstructured data.
